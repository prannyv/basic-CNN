# Convolutational Neural Network

This project was my first attempt at trying to understand how Artificial Intelligence systems operate. This program is a handwriting recognition model that uses **Tensorflow** in Python to employ a neural network with three regular layers and three convolutional layers. 

After completing the model, it was able to predict new digits with over 98% accuracy.
